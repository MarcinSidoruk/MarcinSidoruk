### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am aspiring Data Scientist. 

During last two years I was working with spatial data. In that time I awake my interest to working with data. So I decided to develop my skills in processing and analysis data.  Since that thought I participate in several courses and join weekend bootcamp Junior Data Science to increase my understanding of data and how to work with it. I'm planning further career development in field Data Science.

    - As a group we work with our projects in repository pined.
